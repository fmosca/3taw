## All the Little Things – Sandi Metz

Metz again! This time, a dive in the O in SOLID. I didn't really grokked the meaning and value of the Open/Closed principle before this talk. Clear and insightful, even if it _appears_ to be a beginner's topic.

## One Hacker Way – Erik Meijer

Death to Agile, pt. 2: a Rant with a capital R, when it first came out it didn't make waves, it made a tsunami. Meijer, of LINQ and RX fame among many other functional things, managed to enrage all the Agile twitter that counts: an "extremist", but also a much needed wake up call. After he went through a near-death experience, the talks by the same title took a broader and maybe more considered point of view, but the flames of this first one still burn.

## The Ultimate Game Boy Talk – Michael Steil

And now, for something completely different: i find Retrocomputing mostly cute but boring, but sometimes the Nostalgia Effect, combined with the speaker's passion and the nerding out about the quirks and tricks in a technology, produces some very interesting talks. If you always wanted (or not) to know literally *everything* about the Game Boy, this one is a fun ride.
